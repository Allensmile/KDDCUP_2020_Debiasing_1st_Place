# KDD CUP 2020: Debiasing
### Team: aister

### Introduction
***
+ This track focuses on the fariness of exposure, i.e., how to recommend items that are rarely exposed in the past, to combat the Matthew effect frequently encountered in a recommender system. In particular, performing bias reduction when training on the click data is crucial for the success of this task. Just like there is a gap between the logged click data and the actual online environment in a modern recommender system, there will be a gap between the training data and the test data, mostly with respect to the trends and the items' popularity.
